## Description
I've always enjoyed listening to music, and last year I decided that I'd like
to try making some as well, so I bought an Akai MPK mini. After buying it though
I realized I couldn't find any software online that did exactly what I
wanted, so I decided to write my own. It's classic [shaving the yak](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/YakShavingDefinedIllGetThatDoneAsSoonAsIShaveThisYak.aspx)
but all of this is just for fun, so w/e.

## Installation
As of yet I promise this isn't worth installing, but if for some reason you want to
here are the steps:

`git clone` the repo.

Install packages with
```
yarn
```
and then do
```
yarn run server
```
to start a local development server
